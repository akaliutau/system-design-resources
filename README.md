About
======

This is a list of web resources on technologies tied (directly or proximitly) with architecture and design of microservices.

Total more than 100 resources aggregated

I chose mostly those technologies created on the basis of Java/Scala, but this is a sort of personal choice - microservices, as well as all related services, can be written in any language. 

You can extend this list - see the [Contribution section](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
